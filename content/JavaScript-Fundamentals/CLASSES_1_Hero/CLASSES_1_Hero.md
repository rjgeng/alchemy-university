##  Class Syntax

Classes can be defined using the `class` keyword, followed by its name and curly braces `{}`. Inside these curly braces we can define methods. These methods can be custom or a **constructor**.

The **constructor** is a special function that is called only once per new [instance](Instances.md):

```
class Hello {
    constructor() {
        console.log('hello!');
    }
}

const h1 = new Hello(); // hello!
const h2 = new Hello(); // hello!
```

Both `h1` and `h2` are **instances** of `Hello`. When an instance is created, the `constructor` function is called.

A constructor is a great place to initialize properties on a class instance. We can do so by using the `this` keyword, which is the **instance**:

```
class Team {
    constructor() {
        this.sport = "soccer";
    } 
}

const t1 = new Team();
console.log(t1.sport); // soccer
```

The `sport` property is stored on the instance of `Team`, initialized to "soccer".

##  üèÅ Your Goal: Hero Health

Within your constructor function, add a `health` property to a hero instance and set it to `50`.

When creating a new hero, it should work like this:

```
const hero = new Hero();

console.log(hero.health); // 50
```
