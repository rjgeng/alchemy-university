##  Call-Site

Without explicitly setting `this` with `call` or `apply`, there are a few rules that dictate what `this` will be for a function.

These rules depend on how the function is called. Let's take a look at a function defined as an object's property:

```
const obj = {
    value: 2,
    getValue: function() {
        return this.value;
    }
}
```

☝️ Depending on how we call `getValue`, the result could be **very different**:

```
console.log( obj.getValue() ); // 2
```

We called the function by accessing it on the object's property. The `this` keyword is implictly bound to the object it is being called on.

Let's see another example using the same `obj`:

```
const fn = obj.getValue;

console.log( fn() ); // undefined
```

Whoops! 😱

In this second example, `this` is not the `obj` itself. It is actually the global `this`. Without being called directly on the object, `this` is not bound at all!

>   📖 The place where the function is called is generally referred to as the **call-site** of the function. If the function is not otherwise bound, it will determine the value of `this`.

##  🏁 Your Goal: Add Get Name

Add a function `getName` to the `obj` that will retrieve the `name` when it is called on an object.

For example:

```
const name = obj.getName();

console.log(name); // Bob
```
